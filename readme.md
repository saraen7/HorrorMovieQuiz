## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

I used very minimal styling and instead focused on working with forms and scoring.

## Optimizations

This was my first foray into forms!

## Lessons Learned:

I hard coded a lot of the text into the JS. In the future, I would make heavier use of an array.
